""" Why You Need to Close cursor and connection
When using psycopg2, you're connecting to a live database server (PostgreSQL), and:

connection: opens a session with the database server (holds memory & socket)

cursor: opens a query channel to send/receive SQL operations

If you don't close them, they:

üß† Hold resources open on your machine AND the database server

üï≥Ô∏è Cause connection leaks, especially in production

üßØ Can hit max connection limits (too many clients) and crash the app/db

üêõ May leave locks on tables or rows (especially if you're using BEGIN/COMMIT transactions)
